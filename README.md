-> This folder contains my practice work for HTML and CSS basics.
-> In HTML, I have practiced heading tags, formatting tags, lists, anchor tags, image and video tags,
attributes, and tables to understand the structure of web pages.
-> In CSS, I have worked with selectors, combinators, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, hover effects, the CSS box model,
display properties like block and inline, positioning techniques, Flexbox, and Grid. The main purpose of this practice folder
to build a strong foundation in front-end development and learn how to create well-structured and styled web pages using HTML and CSS.
